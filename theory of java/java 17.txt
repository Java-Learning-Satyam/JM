# Java Naming Convention

 Adopting the accepted conventions for namnig variables, methods and objects in java makes your code easier for others to read

 "Others" here also include you when you come to look at your code weeks or months after you wrote it.

# Things you will name in java are 

 Packages, classes, Interfaces, Methods, Constants, variables, type Parameters

 
# Packages
 
` A package is a way of groupping relates classes and interfaces together

 Always lower case
 Package names should be unique
 use yout internet domain name, reversed, as a prefix for the package name

 Invalid Domain name components
 
 Replace invalid characters(i.e. -) in domain name with an underscore
 Domain name components starting with a number should insted start with an underscore
 Domain name components that are java keywords should have that componantd with an underscore  eg if your domain contain switch then write (_switch)

# Class names 

 CamelCase
 Class names should be noun (they represent things).
 should start with a capital letter
 Each word in the name should also start witha capital (eg LinkedList)

# Interface name
 
 Capitilized like calss names (CamelCase)
 Consider what objects implementing the interface will become of what they eill be able to do 
 	eg:
	List, Comparable, Serializable

# Method name
  
 MixedCase,ofter verbs, Reflect the function peformed or the result returned 
 	eg: size(), getName(), addPlayer()

 # Constants
 
 All UPPER_CASE
 Separate words with undrscore_.
 Declare using the final keyword
 	eg: static final int MAX_INT, static final int SEVERITY_ERROR

# Variable names
 
 mixedCase
 meaningful and indicative
 start with lower case letter
 do not use underscores_
	eg: i, j, delhiCapitals, boxLength

 Type Parameters 
 single Character, capital letters, used in generics
 
 Classe's, integer, double -- all come from java.lang - packages
