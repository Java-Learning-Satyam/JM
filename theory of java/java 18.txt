 Charcater classes : some of these are predefined, others you can define yourself. the peroid or dot is an eg of a predefinrd character class

 Qualifiers : These metachatacters identify the number of occurrences of a character class or literal, required to make a match.  * + ?

 Boundary marchers: or anchors. These specify the position in the text, for eg at start od the txt or the end ^ $ \b
