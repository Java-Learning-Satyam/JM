# Access Modifiers
 The public java keyword is what's called an access modifier
 An access modifier allows us to define which part of our code , or even someone else's code , can access a particular element 


# class Keyword
 The class keyword is used to define a class . The class name will be the text following the keyword , so FirstClass in this case....

# Method 
 
 A methos is a collection of statements ,one or more , that peform an operation 
 
 java looks for a special method  called the main method 
 
 it's the entry point for any java code , and java looks for the main method to stat and run the program when we use it
 
 you can also create your own mathods
 Notice the left and the right culrly braces , the are used to define the code block , or class body

$  System.out.println("Hello, Satyam"); -- to print output in new line

# if-then statement in java 
 The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code , only if a particular test evaluates to true 
 
 this is known as conditional logic
 conditional logic uses specific statements in java to allow us to check a condition , and ececute a certain code based on weather that clndition (the expression) is true ar false 

 this is used to assign = 
 this is equality operator == this tests to see if two operands are considerd equal , and return a boolean value  , in other words is the left operand is equals to the right operand

 A code bolck allows us to execute one or more statement at onse {code between in thsi is known as code block } 

 If 

 $  boolean isAllean = false;
        if (isAllean == false) {  // can also write as (!isAlliean)
            System.out.println("This is no an allien");
            System.out.println("And im scared allien");
        }

 != this is not operator true ka false ka true

 AND -- both side  are true then true &&
 OR  -- only one left or right need to be true || 

$ if(! isCar) -- this is equals to if (isCar == false) -- that is a short form notation , returns true if false , vice aa versa 
  
# Ternary operator 
  the ternary operator java offically called as conditional operator - has 3 operands , the only operator currently in java that does have 3 
 
 The strucure of this operand is
 
 Operand1 ? operand2 : operand3

 1 is boolean if true then return 1 else return 2 operand

 The ternary operator is a shortcut to assign one of two values to a variable , depending on a given condition
 
$ String makerOfCar = "Volkswargen";
        boolean isDomestic = makerOfCar == "Volkswargen" ? false : true; -- in this as the maker of car is not domestic we assign false to it 

        if(isDomestic) {
            System.out.println("This car is domestic to our country");
	   } -- we can replace this as 
 String s = (isDomestic) ? "This car is domestic" : "This car is not domestic";
 System.out.println(s);

or 
 String ageText = (ageOfClint >= 18) ? "over 18" : "still a kid";
