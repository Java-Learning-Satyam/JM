System.out.print("Hello World");

/var -- to list all the variable used in jshell

 int myMinIntValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE; -- to get the max value of the variable intiger
 int myMinIntValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE; -- to get the min value of the variable intiger
 System.out.print(" Integer min value = " + myMinIntValue); -- use + to print value of multiple data type 
 

# Statement
 it is a complete command to be executed it can include one or more expressions 
 
 A DECLERATION statement is used to define a variable by indicating tha data type and name ,optionally to set the var to a specific value

# keywords
 link --- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.9
 java has 51 reserved words that are called keywords 

# Variable
 are a way to store information in our computer ,can be accessed by a name we give them

 When we put something in "" it is called a string litral

 variable is just declaeed just as in c, c++ int myVariable = 10;

 We cannot re-declare a variable in java thats a error 
like we cannot do int a = 10; again int a = 10 ; thata an eror
but in a jshell we can do that but not in ide

# Expression

 expression is the code segment that is on the right side of the equals sign in an assignment or decleration statement

# Java code is case sensitive -- which also include keyword , variable name
	keywords must be in lowercase 

# Wrapper Class 
 
 Java uses the concept of a wrapper class , for all of its eight primitive data types
 A wrapper class provides simple operations , as well as some basic information about the primitice data type , wich canot be stored on the primitive itself
 we saw MIN_VALUE AND MAX_VALUE , are elements of this basic information , for the int data type
 wrapper class have name same as the datatype just the name starts with uppercase letter

 2,147,483,647 -- cannot write so java give this 2_147_483_647

# Data type 
 byte store the shortest rane -128 TO 127			size 8

 short is in between  	       -32768 to 32767 		size 16

 long store the longest reange , 
 To declare a long you need to specify L at the end of decleration eg long myval = 1000L; if the size of the value is grater then the size of intiger i.e 2.14 billino  because the java will treat value less then it as int 
 size = 64

 System.out.print("Long value size " + Long.SIZE); -- used to get size of a data type
 int size 32 bit

# Casting 
 
 casting means to treat or conert a number , from one type to another 
 We put the type we want the number to be in perantheses like 
 (byte) ( myBitMin / 2 );
 short myNewShortValue = (short) (myMinShortValue / 2);

 short myNewShortValue = (myMinShortValue / 2); -- this type dont work because the compiler dont kno th value and treating the statement as an int  -- this is because java uses int by default -- because in this the value may be long or unexpected the compiller through an error
 
short myNewShortValue = (-128 / 2); -- though this will work because the compiler know the value at the time of compiletion  

# Folating point numbers
 
 Floting point numbers are also called real numbers 
 We use them when we need more precession in calculations
 There are two pimitive types in java for expressing floating point numbers , The  FLOAT and DOUBLE , Double is java's default type for any decimel or real number
 We use DOUBLE because it is fast , liberaries are written which uses double , chips can easily calculate value of a double other than float

 In general baoth float and double are great for floating point operations

 But nither is used when precise calculatins are requires - this is due to a limitation with how a floating point num are stores , not ajava problem as such 

 Java has a class calles BigDecimal that overcomes this.

 PRECESSION  it refers to the format and amount of space occupied by the relevent type as compared to int double can represent a small value but a larger decimal value i.e it is used

 if you declare a double then add suffics d / D at the end is option 
 if you are declaring a float then adding a suffic F / f is required if you are assigining a real number to a variable 

 E in the java -- scientific notations can be easily be seen as E38 = 10 to power 38 , the phrase " 10 to the power " 

$ jshell pound to kg

  double myPounds = 200d;
  double myKiloGrams = myPounds * 0.45359237d;
  System.out.print(myKiloGrams);

# Char , string
 a char holds one , and only one , character -- use of char in rela world -- last key pressed by a user in game , loop programmetically through the letters in an alphabet. 
 A char size 16 bits

 we can assign a char in memory by 3 ways 
 
 char mychar = 'D';
 char mychar = '\u0044'; -- unicode method
 char mychar = 68 ;      -- decimal value

 A String is a class that contain a sequence of characters
 strings are immutable - as we concatinate a new string in an old string then new string is created autometically by java compiler and old one is discarted from memory
 if we add a number to a string then the numbers is also treatd as a string  

# Boolean
 it can stoe 1,0 true or false , right or wrong
 developers often use "is" prefix for declaring a boolean variable name such as { isCustomerOverTwenty , isElegibleForDiscount , isMarried } etc
 bool isMarried = false;

# string 
 A string is not a primitive data type in java else it is a class 
 A string can hold multiple characters , literals are stored in double quotes

$ string concatination 
  String myString = "This is a string";
  System.out.print("myString is equals to " + myString);
  myString is equals to This is a string

you can also use unicode in a string like
 myString = "I wish i had  \u00241,000,000.00";
 myString ==> "I wish i had  $1,000,000.00"


# Data type revise
  So java has 8 primitive data type 
	whole number	- byte , short , INT , long
	realnumber		- float , DOUBLE
	single character  - char
	boolean values    - boolean

# Operators
 
 Q what is a operator
 operators in java are special symbols that peform specific opertions on one ,two, or three operands, amd then return a result.
	
 Q Wahat are operands
 An operand is a term used to describe any object that is manipulates by an operator
 int myVar = 15 + 10; -- so 10 and 15 are the operands , Variables can also be an operand

 Q what are experssions
 An expression is formed by combining variables , literals , mathods return values and operators int myVar = 15 + 10; in this 15 + 10 is the expression 
 
# Abbrivated form or shorthand operators
 incremanting by one , same as decrement 
 result++ -- this is postfix increment
 
 result+=1 ; compound assignment operator with + sign we can +, -, /, *,  with any num insted of 1
 these both are stand alone statement
 the compound assignment operator
 x -= y 
 is often said to be
 x = x - y 
 but that is not entirely true if y is not the same data type as x
 x -= y 
 is really
 x = (data type of x ) (x-y) -- it removes the error of loosely conversion this is done implesitely
 so 
 result -= 5.5
 is really 
 result = (int) (result - 5.5); 

  {
   ...>     int result = 1;
   ...>     result -= 1;
   ...>     System.out.print(result);
   ...> }
